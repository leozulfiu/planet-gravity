# planet gravity with box2d

Inspired by [Badland](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.frogmind.badland&hl=de) I created a small
simulation where I test realistic tree behaviour. RevoluteJoins are used to connect the tree parts.
The application is written with [Processing](http://processing.org/) and [Box2D for Processing](https://github.com/shiffman/Box2D-for-Processing)
