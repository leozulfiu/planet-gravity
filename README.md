# planet gravity with box2d

Inspired by [Kerbal Space Program](https://kerbalspaceprogram.com) I created a small
simulation where I test realistic planet gravity. A planet has its own gravitational field which attracts the small rocket.
The application is written with [Processing](http://processing.org/) and [Box2D for Processing](https://github.com/shiffman/Box2D-for-Processing)
